## Background   

Option contracts are a financial derivative representing the right but not obligation to purchase (a **call** option) or sell (a **put** option) a particular security or collection of securities (**basket**)

## Data Sourcing  

We obtained the European options data from 2001 to 2020 using a WRDS subscription. Cleaning and pre-processing were performed to remove outliers...

## Methodology   

We have implemented and experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including the standard multilayer perceptron, Bayesian Neural Network [[1]](#1), Mixture Density Network [[2]](#2), and Support Vector Machine for regression [[3]](#3).  

Each of those methods have their own strengths as well as weakness.  

For probabilistic machine learning methods, while their training takes longer to converge, they are able to provide a confidence level for estimation.   

For methods like the standard multilayer perceptron and the support vector machine, their training takes only a relatively short amount of time thanks to modern computational advancements, but they can only provide a point estimate.  

Benchmarks for the Black Scholes and Heston model are run on Apple M1 with 8.00 GB of RAM.  

All neural network models are tuned using the `RandomSearch` tuner in `tensorflow` and trained for 100 epochs using data obtained above on Google Colab using a Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU.  

## Benchmarks    

We provide some benchmarks for our methods.  MAPE stands for mean absolute percentage error. The time includes the training time and tuning time for neural networks.
